Local stability analysis of the Orr-Sommerfeld-Squire equations

This repository contains scripts to compute spatial and temporal eigenmodes/values of the liearized Navier-Stokes equations, represented by the Orr-Sommerfeld-Squire equations. 
Derivative operator are based on chebishev collocation points.
