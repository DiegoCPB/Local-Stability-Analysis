Local stability analysis of the Orr-Sommerfeld-Squire equations

This repository contains scripts to compute parallel spatial and temporal eigenmodes/values of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations, represented by the Orr-Sommerfeld-Squire equations. 
Derivative operators are computed using chebyshev polynomials and interpolation is done on chebyshev collocation points.
